# Schedule when the bot is running and run it with different profiles/accounts
# This is an advanced setting intended for users that wants to run the bot only in a certain time or that want to run it with multiple accounts
# This setting is to be considered EXPERIMENTAL limited support is provided for it.
# Format is: activitiesSchedule <schedule_1>[;<schedule_2>;...<schedule_n>]
# Schedule format is: <week_day> <start_time>-<end_time> [<plan_name> "<chrome_data_path>"]
# <week_day> format: 1 is monday, 7 is sunday, * is all days. You can have multiple values. Examples: 1 runs on monday; 67 runs on saturday and sunday; * runs all days of the week
# <start_time> format: <HH:MM[:SS]>. HH is hours from 0 till 23 (11 PM), MM is minutes from 0 to 60; SS is seconds from 0 to 60. Seconds are optional. Examples: 1:00 starts at 1 AM, 13:30 starts at 1:30 PM, 00:00:01 starts at 0 AM and 1 second
# <end_time> format: same as <start_time>
# <plan_name> OPTIONAL name of the ini file contained in the plans folder WITHOUT the ".ini" extension. When the scheduling is running settings in this file will be used. On reload both initial ini file and this one will be reloaded and settings in this plan file will override the ones in the original ini file
# <chrome_data_path> OPTIONAL path where the chrome profile is stored. Using this you can run different accounts with different data paths. Path must be enclosed in double quotes
# In the example below you have three scheduling

# difficulty: 1=normal, 2=hard, 3=heroic
# tier: each world boss has different tiers available, check the possible values in game
# chance_to_run: what is the chance to run this WB configuration? The chance to run is weighted compared to the sum of chance to run of all the available configurations
# timer: how many seconds should we wait in the lobby? This parameter is optional: the default value is 300 (5 minutes), maximum value is 600 (10 minutes)
# solo: should the bot run the World Boss solo? 0 = no, 1 = yes. This parameter is optional: the default is 0
# minimum_total_ts: What is the minimum required TS to start the WB? If set to 0, the both will wait for the party to be full,
#    otherwise will join as soon as the minimum values is met. This parameter is optional: the default is 0. This setting has precedence over the minimum_player_ts one.
# minimum_player_ts: What is the minimum TS for a single player to join? This parameter is optional: the default is 0. This setting will be ignored if minimum_total_ts
#    greater than zero and the specified value is met
#
# In the example below two settings are available and the sum of all the chances to run is 100:
# 1) o 1 3 50 -> This setting will run Orlag (o) in normal mode (1) on tier three (3) with a chance to run of 50 (out of 100)
# 2) b 3 11 50 600 0 20000 7000 -> This setting will run Brimstone Syndicate (b) in legendary mode (3) on tier eleven (11) with a chance to run of 50 (out of 100)
#      a timeout of 10 minutes (600 seconds) not in solo (0) requiring a minimum total skill of twenty thousand (20000) and a single player TS of seven thousand (7000)
